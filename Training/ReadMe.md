# Create Sample Vector with OpenCV
Just run the code of opencvSample. \
Adjust the directory of positive samples info file in the code if the directory of positive samples info file is in different path. \
**_-w_** and **_-h_** arguments show the object width and height respectively.

# Training
* Data folder must be created in the directory first.
* Created vec file and the text file that shows the negative samples are given as inputs.
* numPos and numNeg shows number of positive samples and number of negative samples in the neg and pos folder.
* Automatically the training feature type is Haar.
